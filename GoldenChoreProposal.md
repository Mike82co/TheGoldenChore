## Project Description

The Golden Chore is a new way to help todays busy parents. A simple place for household time management. Golden Chore helps families with the frustrating task of assigning, maintaining, and tracking household chores. Golden chore is designed to motivate kids to do their chores by gameifing the process. Parents are able to assign tasks to all of their kids. Tis is not just another task list for chores. The difference with Golden Coin is that it takes care of incentivizing in a fun way. After each chore is completed the kid win coins for that task. The parents get to set the real world value of the coins. For example a single coin could be worth 10 min of screen time or 10 min at the skate park. Each chore is assigned a time limit in which to complete the chore. If the chore is not completed in time the parents can set a "late fee".  Another key feature is the ability for the kids to trade chores (with parents approval). This is a easy and fun way to teach kids responsibility and the value of getting rewarded for work completed on time. 




## Problem statement

Today's parents are spread very thin. They have very busy work lives. They also have the second full-time job of raising responsible children. todays kids are also kept very busy. Just like at work getting the whole team together at home can be a challenge. Even something that seems simple can be a major challenge to arrange. Household chores are no exception. keeping track of who does what and what the reward is can get out of control very quickly. Also teaching kids about the idea of reward for timely work can also take a while. 

* Parents are busy
* Tracking how much time/money ect for each kid is cumbersome
* Teaching kids about reward for work is lengthy 
* People can be forgetful on who is supposed to do what and if it was complete

## How will your project solve this problem?

* This is a one stop solution that will handle they many logistical problems of assigning and tracking household chores
* The parents are in full control
* Parents can keep track of all the kids in the house
* Chores are assigned a coin value
* The coins can be exchanged for real world things like skate time or screen time
* This teaches kids the value of reward for work
* Kids are able to trade chores if one kid wants to earn extra coins
* It teaches kids responsibility in a fun way  
* It makes tracking this process for the parents easy
